A delivery man in n*n grid starts its path from [0,0] and wants to reach each target once. He can only move up, down, right and left.
Each node has a positive number that shows how much cost it takes for him to get there.
There are some boosters like Ice cream (I), Coffee (C) and Biscuit (B) that boost him by 12, 10 and 5 points.
Obstacles are shown by X and targets by T.
This problem solved by BFS, DFS and IDS approaches.
